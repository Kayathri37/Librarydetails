project Overview:
    The Goal of my Project is to create an API that allows for the management of books in a library,including functionalities for adding,retrieving,borrowing,and returning books.
    Adding a new book(POST):
    End point to create a new book entry in the library.
    Retrieving book information by ID(GET):
    Receives details like title,author,genre,and initial borrowed status.
    Endpoint to fetch the details of a specific book using its inique identifier.
    Borrowing a book(PUT):
    End point to update the status of abook to indicate it is currently borrowd.
    updates the isborrowed field and records the borrowed date.
    Returning a borrowed book(PUT):
    Endpoint to retrieve a list of all books that are currently not borrowed.
    Database Table:
    Books Table:The database table will store all the above fields.It should be designed to efficiently manage queries related to borrowing and returning books.
    Functionality:
    Add New Book:Users can submit a request to add new books,which populates the database.
    Get book by Id:Users can retrieve specific book details,useful for checking availability or details.
    Borrowing and returning books:Users can borrow and return books via simple updates, with clear validation to prevent errors (e.g., trying to borrow an already borrowed book).
    List Available Books: Users can see all books that are currently available, facilitating easier management and tracking.
Code Structure and Quality
Separation of Concerns:  code with a clear separation of concerns (controllers,Entity, services, repositories), which enhances maintainability.
Use of DTOs: Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) help in managing data transfer between client and server efficiently.
Error Handling: Including error handling mechanisms to provide feedback for invalid operations (e.g., trying to borrow an already borrowed book).
Conclusion:
Overall, My Library Book Lending System API is a solid project that demonstrates a good understanding of API development, database design, and business logic for library management.
